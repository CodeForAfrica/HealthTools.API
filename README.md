# HealthTools.API

_Providing actionable health information._

The HealthTools API is a free to access, open, and structured service for newsrooms, civic organizations, and governments to access health information.

This API provides a simple wrapper around Elasticsearch data being made available through the [HealthTools Scrapers](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica-SCRAPERS/healthtools_ke) and as a cached proxy for websites unable to be reliably scraped such as Kenya's nursing council website.

## Usage

Specification for the API are:

<!-- TODO: make the specifications a lot less by only listing the static endpoints -->

<!-- TODO: add standards we are using for API provision -->

## Development

Clone the repo from github `$ git clone https://github.com/CodeForAfricaLabs/HealthTools.API.git`

Change directory into package `$ cd HealthTools.API`

Install the dependencies by running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the server by running `$ python healthtools\manage.py runserver`

### Tests

Use nosetests to run tests (with stdout) like so:

```
$ nosetests --nocapture
$ nosetests healthtools/tests
$ nosetests healthtools/tests/doctor.py
$ nosetests healthtools/tests/nurse.py
$ nosetests healthtools/tests/clinical_officer.py
$ nosetests healthtools/tests/health_facilities.py
$ nosetests healthtools/tests/nhif_inpatient.py
