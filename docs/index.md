Install Memcached
 * If on linux follow this [link](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Install)
 * On mac use `brew install memcached`

You can set the required environment variables like so
```<>
$ export APP_DEBUG=<False> # True or False
$ export MEMCACHED_URL=<memcache_url:port> # defaults to 127.0.0.1:8000
$ export GA_TRACKING_ID=<google-analytics-tracking-id>
$ export SMS_USER=<sms-provider-user-id>
$ export SMS_PASS=<sms-provider-passcode>

$ export ES_PORT=<elasticsearch_port>
$ export ES_INDEX=<elasticsearch_index>
```
**If you want to use elasticsearch locally on your machine use the following instructions to set it up**

For linux and windows users, follow instructions from this [link](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html)

For mac users run `brew install elasticsearch` on your terminal

Run memcached on your terminal `$ memcached -p <port you set MEMCACHED_URL to run on>(default: 8000)`

If you set up elasticsearch locally run it `$ elasticsearch`

You can now run the server `$ python manage.py` or `gunicorn manage:app` for production.



## Running the tests

Run memcached on your terminal `$ memcached -p <port you set MEMCACHED_URL to run on>(default: 8000)`

_**make sure if you use elasticsearch locally, it's running**_

Use nosetests to run tests (with stdout) like this:
```$ nosetests --nocapture```
